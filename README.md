# On-Deck
This group project is intended to assist instructors with cold calling students in a classroom. _On Deck_ displays the names of four randomly chosen students at the top of the instructor’s digital lecture materials so that the instructor can direct the next question to those students. Once a student speaks, the instructor is able to use command + left and right arrow keys to navigate to the name and press then press command + up arrow key to dismiss the student.The instructor is also able to discreetly flag students to follow up with them by pressing command + down arrow key.

_On Deck_ equally distributes the cold calls across all students, across multiple days. It is able to keep track of the students who speak and produce a daily log of student participation. This daily log allows instructors to assess students’ individual and overall engagement in the class. _On Deck_ not only has more features than a manual cold calling system, but also provides a more convenient way for the instructor to engage students while lecturing.
